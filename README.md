# Digital Logic Project

VHDL application developed for the course "Digital Logic Design" of the Polytechnic of Milan.

## Goal
The main goal of the project is to implement a hardware module that interacts with a memory behaving according to some given specifications.

## Description
The system receives information about a memory location whose content has to be indexed towards one of the four available exit channels.
The information about the exit channel to use and about the memory address are given through a 1-bit serial input channel, while the exit channels output the bits in parallel of the selected memory word.
